# SafeZone – 2-Minute Pitch

Problem: Many people experience escalating control, threats, stalking, or violence. Early warning and clear guidance can prevent harm—but tools are either too complex, paywalled, or unavailable offline.

Solution: SafeZone is a simple, privacy-first assistant. Describe your situation in your own words; SafeZone scores risk using transparent, rule-based keywords and gives easy next steps. It works offline for essential info and has a one-tap emergency exit.

How it works:
- Frontend (React + PWA) captures text and shows results with a clear DangerMeter.
- Backend (Flask) uses weighted keyword rules (no paid APIs) to classify into LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL.
- Tailored advice and suggested actions update with the level, and resources are cached for offline use.

Why now: Safety should not depend on connectivity, cost, or expertise. Hackathon-ready MVP, extensible to multiple languages and regions.

Impact: Faster recognition of risk, better decisions in the moment, and a pathway to support.

Ask: Pilot with local organizations; contribute resources by region; help expand rules and translations.
